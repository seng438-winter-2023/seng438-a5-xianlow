# Introduction

# 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 
  Using the C-SFRAT tool’s Model Comparison tab to compare the IFR Salvia & Bollinger, IFR generalized Salvia & Bollinger, S Distribution, Discrete Weibull Order 2 and Type III, Geometric, Negative Binomial (Order 2), and Truncated Logistic models, we found that S Distribution and Truncated Logistic had the highest log likelihood. We selected these two models as they are the best fit for our data.
